# MAS-Fall-19-ATL---First-Programming-Assignment-
This repository will be used by Het Piyush Sheth and Jenita Lydia Jebasingh as a mode of communication and to keep track of the work in MAS - First Programming Assignment. 


Instructions to run the code:
-	In order to run this code, you will need Android Studio IDE and an Android Device. You can also use an emulator but you will need some images in the internal storage of the emulator, which can be tricky. So the preferred option would be to just use an Android device.
-	You can download the master branch from the GitHub repository into any directory in your local machine. 
-	Once downloaded, go to Android Studio and Open the downloaded project on it. 
-	Once downloaded, let the IDE Build the solution. You may see some Errors, this happens sometimes in Android Studio if the build hasn’t executed successfully. In such a case, Go to settings and click on Invalidate Caches and Restart. 
-	Once the build is successful, Run the project. Make sure an Android Device (which has USB Debugging turned on) is connected to the machine with a physical USB wire. 
-	Once the application runs on the phone, then you’re all set. Choose any image, and upload. 
-	Since we are only storing the images to the Firebase, we do not need any dedicated link to it in the instructions. The code takes care of that.
